2005-01-22
- added tests that test the testing environment (they deliberately fail)
- grabbed sed.1 and man2html.sed from recent CSed.
- packaging done: ready for version 1.0

2005-01-21
- bug found: $_ was interpreted by regexp.replace(); we now protect
  "$" into "$$" in replace strings.
- POSIX flag implemented. [^\n] and other extensions allowed 
  when not pflag.
- jslint passed OK but for one case of == 0.
- local copy of -n flag implemented (#n used to change the global setting)

2004-02-16
- finished converting jsed to an object.
- removed the dumb compressor.
- netscape/ie handling taken from jslint html page: first usable html page.
- r and w commands implemented by use of hooks sed.read() and sed.write(),
  so that clever HTML interfaces can implement them and let the sed engine 
  use them.

2003-09-26
- started converting jsed to an object, hiding other global variables.

2003-09-21
- played with a compressor for the test suite
- simplified the jsed compactor

2003-09-18
- copied in a dumb compressor (for future experiments aiming at decreasing
  the size of the test suite)
- bracket expressions are now entirely checked: [b-a] and other bad 
  constructs are now intercepted before they are given to the javascript 
  engine; [:alpha:] and other POSIX stuff implemented in the POSIX locale.
- error report shows an approximate location of the error.

2003-09-17
- added { } grouping
- more robust error message passing in compilation phase
- make tgz fixed
- implemented /g and /n flags
- added test suite taken verbatim from csed
- c\ fixed in conjunction with selected() (the text was sometimes
  also output on the first line of a two address range)
- P fixed (newline was not output)
- D fixed (used to branch even if no newline was present)
- RE compilation extended to detect bad REs before they break the
  javascript program. Still TODO: bracket expressions must be checked 
  for bad constructs such as [b-a].
- /./ compiled as /[\x01-\xff]/ because . matches everything but
  newline in javascript

2003-09-16
- debug system halts the interpreter if an endless loop is found
- removed str array (strings can be put directly in cmd[])
- ycomp: set y[0] to a non-null character
- no more endless loop when trying to read line 2
- sedexec() implemented for a subset of commands
- interface changed with the html page
- removed re[], re now stored as strings in cmd[] (because it is sometimes
  needed to compile them with the g flag, and sometimes not)

2003-09-15
- javascript sed implementation project open
- Makefile, changelog.txt, todo.txt added
- a.html: dumb user interface
- jsed.js: started compiling some commands
